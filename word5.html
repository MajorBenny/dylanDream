	<h3>As easy it was to tell black from white <br>

	It was all that easy to tell wrong from right <br>

	And our choices were few and the thought never hit <br>

	That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split <br>

	How many a year has passed and gone <br>

	And many a gamble has been lost and won <br>

	And many a road taken by many a friend <br>

	And each one Iâ€™ve never seen again</h3>
